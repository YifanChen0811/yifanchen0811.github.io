This is Yifan Chen's Self-Promotion Website, which is designed and made by Yifan Chen myself.

First when I start to design the website, I need to think about how to make it happen through html and css codes, so I make the structure easy to accomplish by css grids. The biggest challenge could be html building, because I need to foresee the css codes, not simply the html texts. I draw the script and structure on paper first, then I start to building codes. Pre-production is always important to do.

For the animation, I learn it from Youtube :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhaz36TZG5Y&t=443s. It's an amazing technique to use without Javascript!

All images are created and owned by myself, the vectors are drawn by myself, everything copyright is owned by Yifan Chen, 2022
